A machine image is a Compute Engine resource that stores all the configuration, metadata, permissions, and data from 
one or more disks required to create a virtual machine (VM) instance. You can use a machine image in many system 
maintenance scenarios, such as instance creation, backup and recovery, and instance cloning.
