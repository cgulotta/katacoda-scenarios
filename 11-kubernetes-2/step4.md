Let's kick it up a notch.

## Scaling Containerized Applications

Let's say you wanted to spin up several instances of your code. How would you do it?

### Deployments and StatefulSets

A Kubernetes **deployment** is a resource object in Kubernetes that provides declarative updates 
to applications. A **deployment** allows you to describe an applicationâ€™s life cycle, such as which 
images to use for the app, the number of pods there should be, and the way in which they should 
be updated. 

Click `deployment.yaml`{{open}} to open the object in the editor.

Like the pod, a **deployment** defines containers, images, ports and much more. The most notable
addition is:

- `replicas` : defines the _number of pods_ to spin up.

Let's see it in action!

`kubectl apply -f example/deployment.yaml`{{execute}}

`kubectl get pods`{{execute}}

Notice how many new pods have been created of the form `Tomcat-ReplicaSet-`

#### What about StatefulSets? What are those?

Like a Deployment, a StatefulSet manages Pods that are based on an identical container spec. 
Unlike a Deployment, a StatefulSet maintains a sticky identity for each of their Pods. 
These pods are created from the same spec, but are not interchangeable: each has a persistent 
identifier that it maintains across any rescheduling.

If you want to use storage volumes to provide persistence for your workload, you can use a 
StatefulSet as part of the solution. Although individual Pods in a StatefulSet are susceptible 
to failure, the persistent Pod identifiers make it easier to match existing volumes to the new 
Pods that replace any that have failed.
