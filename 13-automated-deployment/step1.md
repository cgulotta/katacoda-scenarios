# What is automated deployment?

Deployment automation provides the ability to move your software between testing and production environments by using automated processes. 
This leads to repeatable and reliable deployments across the software delivery cycle.

Deployment automation lets you release new features and applications more quickly and frequently, while removing the need for human 
intervention in application deployments.
 
## CI/CD and deployment automation

Deployment automation is an important piece of enabling DevOps practices and managing a CI/CD pipeline.

Continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD) is a method to frequently deliver applications to customers and 
relies on ongoing automation and continuous monitoring throughout the lifecycle, from integration and testing to delivery and deployment. 

Continuous integration usually means a developer’s changes to an application are automatically bug tested and uploaded to a repository 
(like GitHub or a container registry), where they can then be deployed to a live production environment by the operations team 
(or using deployment automation).

Once a developer’s changes to an application are merged, those changes are validated by automatically building the application and 
running different levels of automated testing, typically unit and integration tests, to ensure the changes haven’t broken the app.
