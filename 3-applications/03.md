Now that we know how to input and output text, lets make our game!

Our game is a text-based adventure game. Our player will be given choices and asked to make a decision on what to do next. To facilitate this, we need to understand _branching logic_.

In programming, _branching logic_ can be handled with `if` and `else` blocks. 

```
if some _condition_ is met, 
    do this
else,
    do this
```

let's say our player enters a room with two doors, and we want them to choose one. If they choose the blue door, they'll find a treasure chest. If they choose the red door, they'll find a goblin.

_Feel free to make up your own narrative!_

Edit the code to include the following scenario:

>After entering the room, prompt the player to choose their next move. 
>If they flee, the will survive. If they stand to fight, they will die.

<pre class="file" data-filename="game_2.py" data-target="append"  data-marker="        print('As you open the red door, a fiendish goblin springs to attack you!')">
        next_move = input('Do you fight or do you flee?')
        if next_move == 'fight':
            print('You died.')
        else:
            print('You live!')
</pre>
