Let's make a game!

At the top right, you'll see an _editor_, which we'll use to write our python file `game.py`

And at the bottom right, we have a _terminal_, which we'll used to execute our code.


Write now, we have a two _functions_ `say_hello()` and `main()`. 

In our terminal, if we execute `python game.py`{{execute}} the interpreter will run the program starting with the `main()` function. Try it!
