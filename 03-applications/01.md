Let's make a game!

At the top right, you'll see an _editor_, which we'll use to write our code 

click `game.py`{{open}} to view that file in the editor

And at the bottom right, we have a _terminal_, which we'll use to execute our code

Right now, our code contains a two _functions_ `say_hello()` and `main`. 

In our terminal, if we execute `python example/game.py`{{execute}} 
the python interpreter will run the program starting with the `main` function.
The `main` function then calls the `say_hello()` function.

See if you can print "world" after "hello"!

<pre class="file" data-filename="game.py" data-target="insert"  data-marker="'hello'">'hello world'</pre>
