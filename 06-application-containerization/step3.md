# Okay, what about the Docker Container Engine?

The Docker Container Engine, like a hypervisor, allows _containerized applications_
to use the base machine components like the storage drives (SSD/HDD), 
random access memory (RAM), central processing unit (CPU), network devices, and more.

The _Docker Container Engine_ is the mediator between the application containers
and the physical compute resources.
