## The "Call Stack", "Execution Stack", or "Stack"

Picture in your head a stack of blocks:

If you want to add or remove a block, you have to either _push_ it to or _pop_ it from the top.

This is how your computer looks at instructions and variables. The instructions which are read and executed by the Central Processing Unit (CPU) are called _machine code_.

Machine code includes commands like:
- push a variable onto the stack
- Load this information from memory
- Add this and that
- Store that information in memory
- Move some information from one place to another
- and a few other commands
