A computer cluster is a set of loosely or tightly connected computers that work together so that, 
in many aspects, they can be viewed as a single system. Unlike grid computers, computer clusters 
have each node set to perform the same task, controlled and scheduled by software.

The components of a cluster are usually connected to each other through fast local area networks, 
with each node (computer used as a server) running its own instance of an operating system. In 
most circumstances, all of the nodes use the same hardware and the 
same operating system, although in some setups (e.g. using Open Source Cluster Application 
Resources (OSCAR)), different operating systems can be used on each computer, or different 
hardware.

Clusters are usually deployed to improve performance and availability over that of a single 
computer, while typically being much more cost-effective than single computers of comparable 
speed or availability.
